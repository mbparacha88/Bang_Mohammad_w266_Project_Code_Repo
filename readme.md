# DATASCI 266: Natural Language Processing Final Paper

Welcome to DATASCI w266 Project Repository for John Bang and Mohammad Paracha!

In this paper, we classify medical exam questions from
the MedMCQA dataset, which contains over
193,000 expert-authored questions from AIIMS
and NEET PG exams across 21 medical sub-
jects. We evaluate five models: Naive Bayes,
logistic regression, BERT, BioBERT, and Gem-
ini 1.5 Flash. Unlike previous work that focuses
on answer prediction or open-domain medical
reasoning, our study reframes the problem as
subject-level classification—an underexplored
yet critical task for downstream applications.
Our results show that BioBERT achieves high
precision scores, highlighting the effectiveness
of domain-specific pretraining for understand-
ing medical language.
